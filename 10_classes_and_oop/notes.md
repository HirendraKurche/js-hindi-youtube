# javascript and classes
->prototype based language ( behind the scene implementaion)
## OOP ( programming paradim )

## Object 
- collection of properties (data) and methods (functions)
- toLowerCase

## why use OOP
- code reusability
- easier to maintain and modify
- better organization of code

## parts of OOP
Object literal 

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)


## 4 pillars
Abstraction (hiding details eg like fetch)
Encapsulation (data hiding)
Inheritance (reusing code)
Polymorphism (multiple forms)



## Classes and Objects
- Classes are blueprints or templates for creating objects
- Objects are instances of classes
## Constructors
- special method in a class that is called when an object is created
- used to initialize the object's properties
## Inheritance
- allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class
- used to create a hierarchy of classes
## Polymorphism
- ability of an object to take on multiple forms
- used to perform different actions based on the type of object
## Encapsulation
- hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world
- used to protect the object's internal state
## Abstraction
- hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world
- used to show only the necessary information to the outside world
