    /*
    An Application Programming Interface (API) is a software intermediary that enables two applications or systems to communicate with each other. It acts as a messenger, allowing different programs or components to exchange data and functionality in a structured and standardized way.

    Key Characteristics

    Interface: API provides a defined set of rules, protocols, and tools for building software applications.
    Intermediary: API sits between different applications, systems, or services, facilitating data exchange and processing.
    Standardized: API specifies a common language and format for data exchange, ensuring compatibility and interoperability.

    APIs are used to:

    Share data between different applications or systems
    Integrate third-party services or libraries
    Enable web services and microservices architecture
    Facilitate data exchange and processing between organizations
    
    Types of APIs
    APIs can be categorized based on their architecture, protocol, and functionality. Some common types include:

    REST (Representational State of Resource) APIs
    SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) APIs
    GraphQL APIs
    Microservices APIs
